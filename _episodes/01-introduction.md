With the increasing focus on digital and data science competences here at PharmaSchool it is important to become familiar with working with code. Several elements of data handling, analysis and visualizatio plus workflow automation will be introduced throughout the bachelor as "dry-lab exercises" in a Jupyter notebook format (we will use Google Colab) with Python code. This "Python for PharmaSchool" series of online modules provides an introduction to Python. While going though the online modules here in GitHub, you are at the same time expected to solve the small included code exercises in a Jupyter notebook and complete a quiz on the CMB course page in Absalon.

Python is a widely used open source programming language with almost unlimited possibilities for expansion to perform any data related task you can imagine. Furthermore, Python is easier to learn than many other programming languages, which is one of the main reasons for using Python here at PharmaSchool.
